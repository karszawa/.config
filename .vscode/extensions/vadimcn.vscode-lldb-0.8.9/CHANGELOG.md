# What's New

## 0.8.9
- Bug fixes.

## 0.8.8
- Added [`postRunCommands`](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/blob/master/MANUAL.md#launching).
- Bug fixes.

## 0.8.7
- CodeLLDB will now attempt to auto-generate summaries for compound objects, for which there is no built-in support.
  Previously, it would fall back to displaying object's type instead.
- Fixed breakpoint resolution when dynamically-loaded modules are used.

## 0.8.6
- Filter out build scripts when looking parsing Cargo output.
- New substitution variable for launch configs: `${cargo:program}`.
- Bug fixes.

## 0.8.5
- Added support for [Cargo projects](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/blob/master/MANUAL.md#cargo-support).
- Added support for [logpoints](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_22#_logpoints).
- Added `waitFor` property for "attach" configurations - to wait for the process to launch.
- Custom launch configuration changes (the old ways still work, but marked deprecated):
  - Use `{"request":"custom"}`, instead of `{"request":"launch", "custom":true}`.
  - Renamed `initCommands` and `preRunCommands` to
  `targetCreateCommands` and `processCreateCommands` respectively, to clarify what they do.
- `sourceLanguages` can once again be specified at the launch configuration level.  Workspace-level configuration
 is still possible via `lldb.sourceLanguages`.

## 0.8.2
- Fixed startup bug on Windows.

## 0.8.1
- Added `expressions` âˆˆ { `simple`, `python`, `native` } launch configuration property, which selects the default
  [expression evaluator type](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/blob/master/MANUAL.md#expressions).
- Exception breakpoints are now language specific: "on throw" and "on catch" for C++, "on panic" for Rust.<br>
  In order to implement this, the "sourceLanguages" setting had to be moved to [workspace configuration](#workspace-configuration) level.
- Fixed watch panel bug, which, in rare circumstances, could cause display of incorrect evaluation results.

## 0.8.0
- Added [Parameterized Launch Configurations](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/blob/master/MANUAL.md#parameterized-launch-configurations).
- Display settings such as disassembly display, default variable formats, will now be persisted across debug sessions.
- New command to toggle pointer address display setting.
- Fixed order of precedence when merging of lldb.launch... properties across multiple levels of settings.
- CodeLLDB will now pause execution upon debuggee crash (instead of terminating the debug session).

## 0.7.5
- Fixed LLDB detection on OSX and Windows.

## 0.7.4
- It is now possible to set [default values for launch configurations](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/blob/master/MANUAL.md#workspace-configuration) per-workspace.
- The debugger will now suppress source location information if the source files does not exist on local machine (after mapping paths through `sourceMap`).
This behavior may be altered via `lldb.suppressMissingSourceFiles` configuration setting.
- Bug fixes.

## 0.5.1
- Show pointee's summary rather than its address for pointers and references in "default" formatting
mode.  The address may still be seen when a display format override is specified, e.g. `pointer,x`.
- Bug fixes.

## 0.5.0
- The minumum VSCode version is now 1.11.
- Rust visualizers are now activated automatically (no need for `sourceLanguages: ["rust"]`).
